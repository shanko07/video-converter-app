## Developer
To build this image use the following build command `docker build -t whatever/you:want .`

To run, modify the run command in the top level readme to match your tag.

When you submit a PR and it is merged, docker hub will automatically rebuild `shanko07/vc-app:standalonedocker`
^^ Sadly this doesn't work anymore because docker took away the autobuilding on free accounts
